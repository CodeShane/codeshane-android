=================

The open source (Apache 2.0) portions of my Android utilities library.

This also includes code I no longer use or never completed, which (needless to say) means beware of bugs.

Eventually I hope to put some of the code into compact deployment-ready libraries.

Almost everything is compatible back to Android Cupcake 1.6 (API 4).

Please report issues, and enjoy!
