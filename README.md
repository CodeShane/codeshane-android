=================

The open source (Apache 2.0) portions of my Android utilities library. Also includes code I no longer use or never completed, which (needless to say) means beware of bugs. I'll eventually work some of it into some smaller, usable libraries.

Almost everything is compatible back to Android Cupcake 1.6 (API 4).

Please report issues, and enjoy!
